  "description":"<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is a nonprofit, grassroots civil rights and advocacy group that aims to enhance the understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.</p><p>The CAIR focuses on five areas to fully develop its mission;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Civil Rights Work</strong><br>CAIR\u2019s Civil Rights Department counsels, mediates, and advocates on behalf of Muslims and others who have experienced religious discrimination, defamation, or hate crimes. The department works to protect and defend the constitutional rights of American Muslims, thereby supporting the rights of all Americans.</p><p><strong>Media Relations</strong><br>CAIR\u2019s Communications Department works in conjunction with local and national media to ensure an accurate portrayal of Islam and Muslims is presented to the American public. CAIR monitors local, national and international media in part, to challenge negative stereotypes, but also to applaud and encourage positive representations of Islam and Muslims. Over the years, CAIR has become a respected and credible source for journalists and other media professionals.</p><p><strong>Research</strong><br>CAIR\u2019s Research Department conducts empirical research studies on subjects relevant to the American Muslim community, including gathering and analyzing data for the annual civil rights report. The North American Muslim Resource Guide: Muslim Community Life in the United States and Canada (Routledge) is a product of the research department.</p><p><strong>Education: Conferences, Seminars, and Workshops</strong><br>CAIR organizes regular conferences and training seminars for government and law enforcement agencies, media professionals, and the academic community. These events are designed to present easily accessible and accurate information about Islam and Muslims. CAIR\u2019s TeamWorks sensitivity and diversity training workshop is offered to employers, educators, and organizations as a proactive approach that highlights relevant Islamic practices and offers suggestions for religious accommodation. CAIR also provides training for the Muslim Community and activists in areas such as media relations, public speaking, and civil rights.</p><p><strong>Voter Registration</strong><br>In order to increase Muslim participation in the political arena, CAIR and its chapters regularly sponsor voter registration drives across the country.</p><p><strong>Outreach and Interfaith Relations</strong><br>Each year, groups representing people of all faiths visit CAIR offices to learn more about Islam and Muslims in America. Through these visits, as well as other interfaith initiatives, CAIR strives to educate others about Islam while building strong relationships with other faith communities.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://pa.cair.com/\">https://pa.cair.com/</a></p><p>This organization is part of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OfDCZariSv_iSX2cfcG5dbq-7_poHzwyPbeGM_H9y78/edit#\">Philadelphia Justice and Equity Fellowship.&nbsp;</a></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>",
